"# VehicleHireBookingSystem" 
The source code supplied is to provide techinal solution for Babcock Technical Test - Vehicle Hire Booking System

Requirements:

A vehicle hire company has a number of cars and vans, and a variety of customers, some of whom are individuals who might only hire one vehicle at a time and some of whom are companies 
who might have multiple vehicles on hire at any one time. The hire company has many vehicles of the same make and model. Vehicles are hired on a daily basis, rather than hourly.
They have asked for a simple system to be written to keep a record of the vehicles they own and which ones are currently hired out to customers.

Technoligies used:
Spring boot, JPA/Hibernate , Restful , H2 in memory database, swagger for documentation

I haven't used Vue.js as I don't know it and is not in my CV, if had more time I would have learnt it and used it.
I know Vaadin framework, however is very trickey to use it with Restful apis and would take more time to setup.
Instead I used Postman to validate and test the apis provided

Running the code:

Maven is used for this project

The following command is to generate VehicleHireBookingSystem-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar in the taget directory
	mvn package 

To run the application
change directory to target then execute the following:

	java -jar VehicleHireBookingSystem-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
	
Swagger Documents:
the url is : 
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/vehicle-hire-booking-controller

	
Database:

H2 in memory database is used to hold information
access the data using
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
username:sa
password:password

schema.sql and data.sql both files found under resources to intialize some data for Vehicles and Customers

Limitations:
boookings are not stored in the database instead BookedVehicel class to hold all the bookings.


Manual Testing:

Postman is used for testing

List available vehicles for hire â€“ all vehicles that can be hired today.
